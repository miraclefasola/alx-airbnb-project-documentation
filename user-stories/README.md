# 🏡 Airbnb Backend Documentation — User Stories

This section of the **ALX Airbnb Project Documentation** focuses on translating the use case diagram into actionable **user stories**.  
Each user story defines how users (guests, hosts, and admins) interact with the system and what value those interactions deliver.

---

## 📘 Objective
The goal is to ensure that every functional requirement from the use case diagram is expressed as a **user story**, providing clarity for developers and stakeholders on what needs to be built.
